# Conference-App-JPA-with-Hibernate
A conference app that includes a User and a Registration.
Made by using Spring data JPA 5 with Hibernate. It includes using JPQL and Projection. 
I also used join types like ManyToOne and OneToMany. 
This project is one of the projects done from the Spring Data Course on PluralSight.
